## Overview

Algolite is a lightweight algorithmic trading framework designed as a **learning exercise**. It is **not intended for professional production trading** or as financial advice.  

The project focuses on exploring:  
- Generative AI‚Äôs role in programming, finance, and algorithmic trading  
- Software development concepts  
- Integration of market data, broker APIs, and historic backtesting  

With years of following discussions on Reddit, I noticed one of the biggest challenges for people interested in quantitative/algorithmic finance is the **technical barrier**. As someone who enjoys both finance and software engineering, I decided to revive a command-line trade bot I built in high school and take it a step further.  

The goal is to create an **easily expandable, maintainable, and scalable full-stack product**, while also experimenting with how generative AI can lower the barrier for aspiring traders ‚Äî including some of my own family members who are "professional amateur" stock traders.

## Features

Due to the experimental nature of this project, **I do not recommend using it for live (non-paper) trading, ever**.  

Algolite is designed as a lightweight trading platform. You are in charge of running the strategy and broker server yourself (for maximum security). You can:  
- Use the built-in **Strategy Template** in the default code  
- Follow the documentation for the Strategy Module and extend it in your own IDE  
- Or leverage **generative AI (GPT-5)** and prompt engineering to help non-coders form a basic, working trading strategy
